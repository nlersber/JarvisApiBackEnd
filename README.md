# JarvisApiBackEnd

## Installation
Installation is done by installing the same NuGet packages used in the example project seen in class, with the exception of SwashBuckle. 
Only NSwag was used due to conflicts caused by ambiguous code.

To be used with the frontend found at (https://github.com/nlersber/Jarvis-Frontend-NgRx-Version).
